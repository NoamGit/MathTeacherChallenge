## Challenge Goal 

Build a model that can perform automatic problem solving, written in natural language. On the provided dataset.

## Rules

- The model with the highest accuracy on our test dataset above the baseline will win the competition.  
- Participants must be able to show code, demo their models and explain their approaches.
- Do not train on the included test set that will disqualify your solution. Any other data is free game.
- Up to 4 participants on a team.

## Questions 

I will be monitoring the github issues feel free to add your room number and I will come over to help.
